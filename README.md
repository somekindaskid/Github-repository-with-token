# github repo viewer

**explorer.html** lets you browse any GitHub repo in the browser—no clone, no server. You pick owner and repo, hit LOAD, then click through folders and open files. File contents show in the right panel. Everything runs in the page via the GitHub API.

**What it can do:** List directories and files for any public repo. Open folders to go deeper. Click a file to fetch and display its contents (as plain text). Use an optional token for private repos or to get higher API rate limits (60/hour without, 5000/hour with a token). Don’t put a real token in a public repo or shared file. Use a throwaway or keep it local.

Open `explorer.html` in a browser and you’re good to go.
